## 🔍 What is Greeexploram_AI?

Greeexploram_AI is an original, AI-powered framework that:

- Integrates **satellite data** (SAR, Sentinel, LiDAR) with **3D terrain and ancient sky reconstruction**
- Offers **VR experiences for blind, deaf, and mobility-impaired users**
- Certifies all archaeological discoveries via **blockchain (BNAI protocol)**
- Remembers user actions, emotions and thoughts with **StudSar**, a semantic AI memory
- Builds **predictive archaeological paths** via MCP protocol
- Plants new trees, simulates biodiversity, and regenerates ecosystems

> *“We search to understand. We understand to protect.”*  
> — Sara (inspirational source of the project)
